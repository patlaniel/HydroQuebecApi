# HydroQuebecApi

.Net core 5.0 library (written in C#) to fetch consumption data from the HydroQuebec site. 

It is heavily inspired by @titilambert's [pyhydroquebec](https://github.com/titilambert/pyhydroquebec), especially the login process. See ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.

*Note: Hydro-Quebec does not have a public API. This library is provided as-is, with no warranty or guarantees.*

## Usage
Open and build the solution in Visual Studio 2019 or 2022.

The `Example` project demonstrates how to use the library. It is fairly self-explanatory. 

Look at the different `HydroQuebecApi\Models` classes to determine what kind of information can be obtained.
