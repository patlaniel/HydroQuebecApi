# HydroQuebecApi

.Net core library (written in C#) to fetch consumption data from the HydroQuebec site. 

It is heavily inspired by the @titilambert [pyhydroquebec Python application](https://github.com/titilambert/pyhydroquebec), especially the login process. See ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.

*Note: Hydro-Quebec does not have a public API. This library is provided as-is, with no warranty or guarantees.*

## Usage
The `Example` project demonstrates how to use the library. It is fairly self-explanatory. 

Look at the different `HydroQuebecApi\Models` classes to determine what kind of information can be obtained.
